‚≠êÔ∏è 1Ô∏è‚É£ What is SQLAlchemy?
      ‚≠êÔ∏èSQLAlchemy is an open-source Python library. It is an ORM(object Relational Mapper) which maps Relational
        tables to python classes and objects.That means,You work with Python classes and objects, not raw SQL.
      ‚≠êÔ∏èIt helps python (here, flask) talk/interact to a relational database (like SQLite or PostgreSQL).
      ‚≠êÔ∏èIt combines the power of python with SQL.

      üìå Part 2:-
           ‚úÖ SQLAlchemy is a Python library for working with databases.

           ‚úÖIt has two main parts:

            1Ô∏è‚É£ SQLAlchemy Core (lower-level) "(to understand the working go to  folder SQLAlchemy_core_demo )"
                Works with SQL directly but in a Pythonic way.
                You define tables, columns, and write queries in Python code.

            2Ô∏è‚É£ SQLAlchemy ORM (Object Relational Mapper) (higher-level)
                Lets you map Python classes to database tables.
                Makes querying feel like using objects.

             Differnce-:
            ‚úÖ SQLAlchemy Core

                 1.Low-level, explicit
                 2.You describe tables, columns, SQL statements directly in Python
                 3.Closer to writing raw SQL, but safer and structured
                 Use case-:Scripting, data migrations, ETL, complex SQL
                 
            ‚úÖ SQLAlchemy ORM
                 
                 1.High-level, object-oriented
                 2.You map Python classes to database tables
                 3.Lets you work with Python objects instead of SQL rows  
                 Use case-:Business apps, REST APIs, Flask/Django apps
