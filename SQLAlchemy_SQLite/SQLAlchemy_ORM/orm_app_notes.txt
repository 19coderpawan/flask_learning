1. First, you need to install the package.
    pip install flask_sqlalchemy

2.app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///site.db'
->sqlite:///site.db → will create a local file site.db as your database.    
->This tells Flask where your database is.

3.app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
->Controls whether SQLAlchemy tracks modifications of objects in memory and signals events.
->Turns off this extra overhead.
  Makes your app faster.Removes the warning in your terminal.

4.db=SQLAlchemy(app)
->it connects your application to your database and db is an object here.  
->Lets you define models (tables as Python classes).
->Gives you access to db.session to add, update, query, and delete records.

5.class Student_table(db.Model):
    id=db.Column(db.Integer(),primary_key=True)
    name=db.Column(db.String(20),nullable=False)
    branch=db.Column(db.String(20),nullable=False)

->A model is a Python class that defines a table in your database.

note(IMP)-: now that you have define a model/table you need to create the database and inside that you will
            have your table in this case(Student_table).
            for that go to your current directory where you app.py is located 
              1.type Python
              2.from orm_app import db,app
              3.with app.app_context():
              4. ...  db.create_all()
              5. double enter
              your database will appear in the current directory.

          -->1️⃣ from orm_app import app, db
             ✔️ orm_app is your Python file (likely named orm_app.py).  
             app: your Flask application object
             db: your SQLAlchemy database object    

          -->2️⃣ with app.app_context():
             ✔️ In Flask, some operations need an application context.

             ⭐ The app context is Flask’s way of:
                “I know which Flask app is active. I know its config. I know its DB connection.” 
                app context = “Flask knows what app you mean.”

          -->3️⃣ db.create_all()
               ✔️ This is a method from Flask-SQLAlchemy.

               ✅ It:
               ⭐ Looks at all your models you defined with db.Model.
               ⭐ Figures out the SQL schema.
               ⭐ Connects to the database (using the URI in your config).
               ⭐ Runs CREATE TABLE statements if those tables don’t exist yet. 
               -->create_all() won’t delete or modify existing tables.    
               -->Creates the database file (if not already present)
               -->Creates the tables defined in your models (if not already present)
