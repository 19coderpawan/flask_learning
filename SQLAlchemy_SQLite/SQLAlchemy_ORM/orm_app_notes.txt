1. First, you need to install the package.
    pip install flask_sqlalchemy

2.app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///site.db'
->sqlite:///site.db â†’ will create a local file site.db as your database.    
->This tells Flask where your database is.

3.app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
->Controls whether SQLAlchemy tracks modifications of objects in memory and signals events.
->Turns off this extra overhead.
  Makes your app faster.Removes the warning in your terminal.

4.db=SQLAlchemy(app)
->it connects your application to your database and db is an object here.  
->Lets you define models (tables as Python classes).
->Gives you access to db.session to add, update, query, and delete records.
