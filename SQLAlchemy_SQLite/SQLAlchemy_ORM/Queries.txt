1.In the python shell command-:locate your directory and type this to insert the data in the table.
>>> from orm_app import Student_table,db,app
>>> new_student=Student_table(id=1,name="pawan",branch="mca")
>>> with app.app_context():
...     db.session.add(new_student)
...     db.session.commit()

explation-:->>new_student = Student_table(id=1, name="pawan", branch="mca")
           üìå What it does:
           Creates a new Python object of type Student_table using your model class.
           Sets the fields:
           id = 1
           name = "pawan"
           branch = "mca"
           ‚úÖ Think of it like this:
           You just created a student record in memory.
           ‚ö†Ô∏è Nothing is in the database yet!
           It‚Äôs only a Python object for now.

           ->>db.session.add(new_student)
              ‚≠ê What it does:
              Tells SQLAlchemy:
              ‚ÄúI want to add this new student object to the session.‚Äù
              ‚úÖ But:
              Nothing is actually written to the DB yet!

           -->db.session.commit()
                ‚≠ê What it does:
                Executes all pending SQL commands in the session.
                In this case:
                Runs an INSERT INTO student_table (id, name, branch) VALUES (1, 'pawan', 'mca').
                ‚úÖ Now your new student is really stored in the database!
